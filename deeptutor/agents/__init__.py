"""
Agents Module - Unified agent system for OpenTutor.

This module provides a unified BaseAgent class and module-specific agents:
- solve: Question solving agents (MainSolver, SolveAgent, etc.)
- research: Deep research agents (DecomposeAgent, ResearchAgent, etc.)
- question: Question generation agents (ReAct architecture, separate base)
- chat: Lightweight conversational agent with session management

Note: ``book`` is an independent top-level module under ``deeptutor/``
(``deeptutor.book``). Its agents still inherit from :class:`BaseAgent`
defined here but are not part of the ``deeptutor.agents`` package.

Usage:
    from deeptutor.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

    class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
        async def process(self, *args, **kwargs):
            ...
